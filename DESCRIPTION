Description: This package provides an easy-to-use interface for the 
 Pushbullet service which provides fast and efficient notifications 
 between computers, phones and tablets.  An account has to be registered 
 at the site http://www.pushbullet.com site to obtain a (free) API key.
 .
 The package currently uses the curl binary directly as using the RCurl 
 package worked only partially: messages can be sent, but return codes 
 from the service are being lost.  
Imports: utils, RJSONIO
SystemRequirements: The 'curl' binary has to be in the path (and this is
 checked at package startup), a user API key which can be obtained from 
 http://www.pushbullet.com, and one or more devices to push messages to 
 which may be any one of an (Android or iOS) phone, iPhone, or the Chrome
 browser  provided the corresponding Pushbullet 'app' has been installed on
 any one of these.

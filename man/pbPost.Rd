\description{
This function posts a message to Pushbullet. Different types of
messages are supported: \sQuote{note}, \sQuote{link} or
\sQuote{address}.
}
\details{
This function invokes the \sQuote{pushes} functionality of
the Pushbullet API; see \url{https://docs.pushbullet.com/v2/pushes} for more
details.

When a \sQuote{note} is pushed, the recipient receives the
title and body of the note.  If a \sQuote{link} is pushed, the recipient's web
browser is opened at the given URL.  If an \sQuote{address} is
pushed, the recipient's web browser is opened in map mode at the
given address.

If \sQuote{recipients} argument is missing, the post is pushed to
\emph{all} devices in accordance with the API definition. If
\sQuote{recipients} is text vector, it matched against the device
names (from either the config file or a corresponding
option). Lastly, if \sQuote{recipients} is a numeric vector, the
post is pushed the corresponding elements in the devices vector.

In other words, the default of value of no specified recipients results
in sending to all devices. If you want a particular subset of
devices you have to specify it name or index. A default device can be set
in the configuration file, or as a global option. If none is set, zero
is used as a code to imply \sQuote{all} devices.

The earlier argument \code{deviceind} is now deprecated and will
be removed in a later release.
